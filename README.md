# React Jobs
This Repository is the code base of a simple site simulating a Job Application Market ( without auth ). <br/>
It uses Json as the backend DataBase and Vite, React and TailWindCSS for the mix up and the Front End.<br/>
It was my first site on React. Built it with this [Tutorial](youtube.com)
